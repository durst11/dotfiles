# Chezmoi dotfiles

I organize my dot files with Chezmoi below are brief descriptions of what is being managed.

- `private_dot_config/starship/`
  - `starship.toml`
    - Primary starship config a work in progress
    - trying to set an Everforest theme
  - `starship_old.toml`
    - The original config to be removed when primary is "done"
  - `starship_wimpy.toml`
    - Copy of a config by Martin Wimpress using as an example will remove when primary is "done"

- `dot_aliasesrc`
  - aliases and commands that get sourced into my `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` files
- `dot_zshrc`
